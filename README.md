## OPTIONS

#### Setup

1. Intall packages in requirements.txt file into your virtual environment.

2. Download chromedriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
and save it in your Program Files (x86) folder.  You could save it somewhere
else but you would have to change the file path in the scrape module and this
is the recommended location.

3. Download DB Browser for SQLite [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/). This 
will help you easily view your database or make minor changes without
having to write a bunch of SQL statements.

4. Run creation.py file to initialize database and tables.
